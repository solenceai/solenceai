# Solence AI

**AI-powered security infrastructure for Solana**

We're building tools that make it easier to trust wallet addresses on Solana. Our first product is a security scanner API that gives you instant risk assessments on any wallet.

## What we're shipping

**[solenceai-api](https://github.com/solenceai/solenceai-api)** - REST API for wallet security analysis  
Get deterministic risk scores, AI insights, and mint on-chain safety badges for qualifying wallets. Built with TypeScript, powered by OpenAI, runs on Solana mainnet.

```bash
curl -X POST https://solenceai.com/api/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"}'
```

**Why this matters:**  
DAOs need to vet multisig signers. DeFi protocols want to screen high-value users. OTC traders need counterparty due diligence. We handle the security analysis so you can focus on building.
